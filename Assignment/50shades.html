    <h1>Fifty Shades of Grey</h1>
    <p class="psub">
      When college senior Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) steps in for her
      sick roommate to interview prominent businessman Christian Grey (Jamie
      Dornan) for their campus paper, little does she realize the path her life
      will take. Christian, as enigmatic as he is rich and powerful, finds
      himself strangely drawn to Ana, and she to him. Though sexually
      inexperienced, Ana plunges headlong into an affair -- and learns that
      Christian's true sexual proclivities push the boundaries of pain and
      pleasure.
