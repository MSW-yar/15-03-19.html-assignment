    <h1>The Meg</h1>
    <p class="psub"> 
      Previously thought to be extinct, a massive creature attacks a deep-sea
      submersible, leaving it disabled and trapping the crew at the bottom of
      the Pacific. With time running out, a visionary oceanographer recruits
      rescue diver Jonas Taylor to save the crew and the sea itself from an
      unimaginable threat -- a 75-foot-long prehistoric shark known as the
      Megalodon.
