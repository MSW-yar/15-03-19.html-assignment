    <h1>The Expendables 3</h1>
    <p class="psub">
      Years ago, Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) co-founded the Expendables
      with Conrad Stonebanks (Mel Gibson). After Stonebanks became an arms
      dealer, Ross was forced to kill him -- or so he thought. Now, Stonebanks
      is back and he's on a mission to end the Expendables. Ross decides that
      the way to fight old blood is with new blood, so he assembles a team of
      younger, faster, more tech-savvy recruits. The battle to topple Stonebanks
      becomes a clash of old-school methods vs. high-tech expertise.
